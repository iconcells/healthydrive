# Healthy Drive App for Smart Drive Link SDL (android)

The app combins Samsung watch Heart Rate Widget, smart phone and Smart Drive Link to create a safe driving experience for senior to get early notification when they have heart problem.  From the Watch, the app uses the Heart Rate detector to access the heart rate information for the heart rate monitor of the driver.  The built-in sensor on the back of the device detects the driver's heart rate.
